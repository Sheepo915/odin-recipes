    <h2>What are Cream Pudds?</h2>
    <p>
        Cream puffs, or profiteroles, are French choux pastry balls filled with cream. Choux pastry is made without
        leavening agents — instead, it relies on a high moisture content to create steam and puff the pastry during
        baking.

    <h2>Cream Puff Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Here's what you'll need to make this top-rated cream puff recipe:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Instant Pudding Mix</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                This convenient cream puff recipe has an easy filling made with instant vanilla pudding mix.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Cream and Milk</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                You don't have to whip the heavy cream and milk — just mix them with the pudding mix and refrigerate to
                set.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Butter</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Butter adds flavor, keeps the flour from clumping, and prevents the layers from sticking together.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Water</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Choux pastry relies on steam for its texture, so this cream puff recipe calls for an entire cup of
                water.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Salt</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Just a pinch of salt brings out the delicate flavors in the choux pastry.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Flour</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                All-purpose flour adds structure to the choux pastry and works with the water to create the perfect airy
                texture.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Eggs</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Whole eggs support the structure, lend rich flavor and color, and add moisture to the choux pastry.
            </p>

    <h2>How to Make Cream Pudds</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Make Filling</b>
        <br>
        Combine the instant pudding mix, heavy cream, and milk in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate until the filling
        is set
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Make Choux Pastry</b>
        <br>
        Bring butter and water to a boil, then add the flour and salt. Stir until the mixture forms a ball. Transfer the
        ball to a mixing bowl, then beat in eggs one at a time. Drop spoonfuls onto an ungreased baking sheet. Bake in a
        preheated oven until they're golden brown on the outside and dry on the inside.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Fill the Cream Puffs</b>
        <br>
        Let the choux pastry cool. Fill the cream puffs in one of two ways: Split the pastries and fill or pipe the
        pudding mixture into the shells
    </p>

    <h2>How to Serve Cream Puffs</h2>

    <h2>Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise</h2>
    <p>
        "Wonderful recipe," according to LCAROLINE. "Very light and delicious. A tip, though, for this and all cream
        puff recipes: After baking is finished, turn off the oven, crack the door open with a towel or potholder, and
        let stand in the oven for about an hour. This prevents them from sagging!"
        <br><br>
        "This was very good," says Susan. "I added a vanilla bean into the mix to give it a punch. To finish it off, I
        covered it in icing sugar and then drizzled chocolate and a raspberry reduction over it. It looked good and
        tasted great."
        <br><br>
        "WOW!!! What a recipe," raves one Allrecipes community member. "I made this and substituted the vanilla pudding
        mix for the pistachio pudding mix and it was phenomenal. It will definitely be in my recipe box."
